# enstaller configuration file
# ============================
#
# This file contains the default package repositories, and configuration,
# used by enstaller 4.5.3 for the Python 2.7 environment:
#
#   sys.prefix = '/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3'
#
# This file was created by initially running the enpkg command.


# The EPD subscriber authentication is required to access the EPD repository.
# To change this setting, use the 'enpkg --userpass' command which will ask
# you for your username and password.
EPD_username = 'ivan@bach.inm.ras.ru'


# use_webservice refers to using 'https://api.enthought.com/eggs/',
# the default is True, i.e. the webservice URL is used for fetching eggs.
# Uncommenting changes this behaviour, to use the explicit IndexedRepos
# listed below.
#use_webservice = False

# The enpkg command is searching for eggs in the list 'IndexedRepos'.
# When enpkg is searching for an egg, it tries to find it in the order
# of this list, and selects the first one that matches, ignoring
# repositories below.  Therefore the order of this list matters.
#
# For local repositories, the index file is optional.  Remember that on
# Windows systems the backslaches in the directory path need to escaped, e.g.:
# r'file://C:\repository\' or 'file://C:\\repository\\'
IndexedRepos = [
#  'https://www.enthought.com/repo/ets/eggs/{SUBDIR}/',
  'https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/GPL-eggs/{SUBDIR}/',
  'https://www.enthought.com/repo/epd/eggs/{SUBDIR}/',
# The Enthought PyPI build mirror:
  'http://www.enthought.com/repo/pypi/eggs/{SUBDIR}/',
]

# Install prefix (enpkg --prefix and --sys-prefix options overwrite this).
# When this variable is not provided, it will default to the value of
# sys.prefix (within the current interpreter running enpkg)
#prefix = '/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3'

# When running enpkg behind a firewall it might be necessary to use a proxy
# to access the repositories.  The URL for the proxy can be set here.
# Note that the enpkg --proxy option will overwrite this setting.
#proxy = <proxy string>  # e.g. "123.0.1.2:8080"

# Uncommenting the next line will disable application menu item install.
# This only effects the few packages which install menu items,
# which as IPython.
#noapp = True
